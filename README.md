# Odin-Etch-a-Sketch
This is done in vanilla javascript. A simple drawing board where you can draw pixelated style art by simply hovering the mouse on the drawing board.
While doing this main focus was to implement the functionalities rather than the looks and fancy front end designs.
You can change the grid size from 1 to 100 unit.
There are options for choosing the rgb color mode labeled as rainbow and the traditional color of black and white.
ALso another core functionality if you draw in the same space over and over again the color gets darker. 
For example the color gets from grey to pitch black after hovering over the mouse in the same spot for several times.
